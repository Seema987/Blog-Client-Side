## Bugs faced

1. I had problem making my delete button work and delete the post instantly onclick. After fixing the spellings and using filter to my post solved this issue. 
2. I had a situation where my data whould not show on the page. Matching the variable names and the name of datbase fixed this problem. 
3.  I had a problem where my login page would not show first when the app loaded. Making minor changes on the routes fixed this problem.
